## Speed Typing


> This is a speed typing app. It is inspired by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw-SYSG-028) video tutorial on youtube. In this app, I added a lot of complexities like flicker score, slider bar, flicker counter, save highest score on local storage and many more. I wrote this application using OOP or Object Oriented Programming.
